Software goals are to continue on with Codecademy - Python. I'm almost 50% done. I'm also working on a GIS python
tutorial because the problems are understandable to me and I get to use the actual python interpreter. I was unable to
get through all the questions on the week 2 worksheet during class time, so I'll keep working on them.
